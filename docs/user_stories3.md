as a user i want be able to have a aplication without many bugs:
bug is see:
    we should have a default box size , but if the text inside is to much , we should use a overflow y to scroll it

    now i also want to be resize the nodes, make it simple if put the mouse pointer on the border of the node, i should see a icons that indicates and can increase his size 

    remember to add the scroll, increse/reduce size of the box also to the .md nodes, 

    when i double click a node i should be able to edit it inside the node, rigth now the iditor open on other parts of the canvas, i mean just make it like a normal standard canva editor, double click and edit the node simple, 


    also the generate "generate ideaas" buttons not always appear on top of the node, its appear randomly on the canvas, make it appear always on top of the node, 


    lets also add a base url in the panel, put the url openrouter as default, but the user can change it so he can use other base url and other api keys ,
    also this panel should appear only when i click config button, i mean lets add a config button that makes appear and disappear , this ways only show when i want 


    now lets remove the mock node creations when not using an apikey configuration, make it simple, just sned a message of need to configure apikey


    given that the generated nodes are created below, the conector arrow should be from the bottom not the rigth side, of the current node, fix that 





    now we connect nodes , we send the conected nodes content also to the ai, but only his parents and parents of parents and so on , like on the web version, 
        
    now i should see from which ai model output is the node created, so for this we put a simple tooltip or text on the top of the node created, saying his model created, like on the web version 


    i have a path problems 
    i have some .md files. that are nested folder for eample the test3.md
    shoud be test3.md to folder1/test3.md , thats why i got failed to load file. fix this problme, 


    as a user i see the markdown text is being hiddedn, for exampel a big senteces only show the initial words, but then the rest gets hidden, so to fix this , just append the text to the next line, i mean make it simple 

    as a user when i navifate around the canvas nand then  i double click the nodes to edit i see another nodes to edit it, i mean i see double nodes, one where the text is and the other is the node where i can edit the text, fix this duplicate node, i just want the original and only edit there, 

    when adding or editing text on the nodes, sometimes the
    nodes gets removed when i fisnish 
    editing them , read the code and create 
    posibles causes first and tell me 


    lets make the nodes respect the format of thetext, i mean sometimes i use a enter button and i still see the words next to another instead of one below the other, tell me if you undertood the bug


    copying and pastetinf the content of the 
    node is working, i mean comand a and 
    comand c and comand v are not working at 
    text inside the nodes

     lets prepare this codebase for release as opesource, lets start with
   the icons of the marketplace , also tell me what do next


    add  gruop selection  to move and delete a group of nodes 

    save also the name of the model in the node, added it the jsoncavas so its saved after closing 



    > good now lets improve the nodes button , lets add the new button that will open a   │
│   models of the content of the node, happens that sometimes the ocntent is a lot of   │
│   text and i want to read it like a normal text file, so add this button ,  


now lets posible for only using relatives files path on     │
│   the .canvas files, cause creating absolutes path is complating more the file , so to make this change simple, lets jsut no make it backwards comptible,s just make the code work with relative path and thats it,  remember this a mvp so we do not need compatibility


lets add the feuature of chaining nodes content , ween we send the nodes to the ai genertae content, i mean 
    now we connect nodes , we send the conected nodes content also to the ai, but only his parents and parents of parents and so on , like on the web version, 

did you undertand the request ?
