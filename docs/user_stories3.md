as a user i want be able to have a aplication without many bugs:
bug is see:
    we should have a default box size , but if the text inside is to much , we should use a overflow y to scroll it

    now i also want to be resize the nodes, make it simple if put the mouse pointer on the border of the node, i should see a icons that indicates and can increase his size 

    remember to add the scroll, increse/reduce size of the box also to the .md nodes, 

    when i double click a node i should be able to edit it inside the node, rigth now the iditor open on other parts of the canvas, i mean just make it like a normal standard canva editor, double click and edit the node simple, 


    also the generate "generate ideaas" buttons not always appear on top of the node, its appear randomly on the canvas, make it appear always on top of the node, 


    lets also add a base url in the panel, put the url openrouter as default, but the user can change it so he can use other base url and other api keys ,
    also this panel should appear only when i click config button, i mean lets add a config button that makes appear and disappear , this ways only show when i want 


    now lets remove the mock node creations when not using an apikey configuration, make it simple, just sned a message of need to configure apikey


    given that the generated nodes are created below, the conector arrow should be from the bottom not the rigth side, of the current node, fix that 





    now we connect nodes , we send the conected nodes content also to the ai, but only his parents and parents of parents and so on , like on the web version, 
        
    now i should see from which ai model output is the node created, so for this we put a simple tooltip or text on the top of the node created, saying his model created, like on the web version 


    i have a path problems 
    i have some .md files. that are nested folder for eample the test3.md
    shoud be test3.md to folder1/test3.md , thats why i got failed to load file. fix this problme, 


    as a user i see the markdown text is being hiddedn, for exampel a big senteces only show the initial words, but then the rest gets hidden, so to fix this , just append the text to the next line, i mean make it simple
