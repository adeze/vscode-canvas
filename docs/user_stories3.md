as a user i want be able to have a aplication without many bugs:
bug is see:
    we should have a default box size , but if the text inside is to much , we should use a overflow y to scroll it

    now i also want to be resize the nodes, make it simple if put the mouse pointer on the border of the node, i should see a icons that indicates and can increase his size 

    remember to add the scroll, increse/reduce size of the box also to the .md nodes, 

    when i double click a node i should be able to edit it inside the node, rigth now the iditor open on other parts of the canvas, i mean just make it like a normal standard canva editor, double click and edit the node simple, 


    also the generate "generate ideaas" buttons not always appear on top of the node, its appear randomly on the canvas, make it appear always on top of the node, 

    



    lets also add a base url in the panel, put the url openrouter as default, but the user can change it so he can use other base url and other api keys
