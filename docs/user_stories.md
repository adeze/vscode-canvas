# User Stories - Infinite Canvas VS Code Extension

## Primary User Story

**As a developer using VS Code**, I want to open and edit `.canvas` files directly within VS Code, so that I can work with my infinite canvas projects without switching between VS Code and a web browser.

## Detailed Requirements

### File Integration
- **As a VS Code user**, I want to double-click on `.canvas` files in the file explorer and have them open with the infinite canvas editor
- **As a developer**, I want the extension to automatically associate with `.canvas` files
- **As a user**, I want to save my canvas work using VS Code's standard save commands (`Ctrl+S`)

### Editor Experience  
- **As a canvas user**, I want the same infinite canvas functionality available in VS Code as I have in the web version
- **As a developer**, I want to use all existing canvas features: text nodes, AI generation, markdown rendering, zoom/pan controls
- **As a VS Code user**, I want the canvas editor to feel native to VS Code with proper integration

### Workflow Integration
- **As a project maintainer**, I want to store `.canvas` files alongside my code files in the same repository
- **As a team member**, I want to version control `.canvas` files like any other project asset
- **As a developer**, I want to access canvas files through VS Code's Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`)
